# Advanced trading strategies
[probably worth it to add figures]

Advanced options trading strategies are designed to help traders achieve their financial goals while minimizing their risk exposure. In this guide, we'll cover three advanced options trading strategies: managing defined/undefined risk, synthetic positions, and spreads.


## Managing Defined/Undefined Risk
Options trading can be classified into two types of risks - defined risk and undefined risk. Defined risk strategies are those where the maximum possible loss is known in advance. On the other hand, undefined risk strategies have the potential to result in an unlimited loss. Managing risk is crucial when trading options, and it's important to understand how to do so effectively.

### Defined Risk Option Trading Strategy
A popular defined risk option trading strategy is a *bull call spread*. This strategy involves buying a call option at a lower strike price and selling a call option at a higher strike price. The purchased call option acts as a long position while the sold call option acts as a short position. This strategy limits both the potential profit and potential loss of the trade.

For example, let's say you're bullish on XYZ coin, which is currently trading at $50 per token. You could execute a bull call spread by buying a call option with a strike price of $45 and selling a call option with a strike price of $55. If the token price rises above $55 by expiration, your profit will be limited to the difference between the strike prices, minus the cost of the options. If the tooken price falls below $45, your loss will be limited to the cost of the options.

### Undefined Risk Option Trading Strategy
An example of an undefined risk option trading strategy is selling a naked call option. This strategy involves selling a call option without owning the underlying token. If the token price rises above the strike price of the sold call option, the trader could face unlimited losses.

For example, let's say you sell a naked call option on XYZ token with a strike price of $60 for a premium of $3. If the token price rises to $70, the call option will be exercised, and you will be obligated to sell the token at $60 per share. However, if the token price continues to rise, your losses could be unlimited.



## Synthetic Positions
A synthetic position is a trading strategy that involves creating a position that mimics the risk/reward profile of another position. Typically, this results in higher capital efficiency, as you are exposed to the Profit profiles of an asset without acutally owning it. Synthetic positions can be either short or long:

### Synthetic Long Position
A synthetic long position is a trading strategy that mimics the risk/reward profile of owning an underlying asset using options. To create a synthetic long position, a trader would buy a call option and sell a put option with the same strike price and expiration date.

For example, let's say a trader wants to create a synthetic long position in XYZ coin, which is currently trading at $50 per token. The trader could buy a call option with a strike price of $50 and sell a put option with a strike price of $50, both expiring in one month. The trader's profit potential is similar to owning the token outright if the token price rises above $50. If the token price falls below $50, the trader will be assigned the token and have to purchase it at the strike price of $50.

### Synthetic Short Position
Conversely, a synthetic short position is a trading strategy that mimics the risk/reward profile of shorting an underlying asset, such as a token, while using options. To create a synthetic short position, a trader would sell a call option and buy a put option with the same strike price and expiration date.

For example, let's say a trader wants to create a synthetic short position in XYZ coin, which is currently trading at $50 per share. The trader could sell a call option with a strike price of $50 and buy a put option with a strike price of $50, both expiring in one month. The trader's profit potential is similar to shorting the token outright if the token price falls below $50. If the token price rises above $50, the trader will have to purchase the token at the strike price of $50 to cover the short call option position.



## Spreads
A somewhat similar strategy to synthetic positions, described above are *spreads*. A *spread* is an options trading strategy that involves buying and selling options on the same underlying asset. Contrary to Sythetic positions though, they need not have the same expiration date and strike. Spreads can be used to limit risk, increase potential profits, or both.


### Vertical Spread
One type of spread is a vertical spread. A vertical spread involves buying and selling options with the same expiration date but different strike prices. For example, if you're bullish on a token, you can buy a call option with a lower strike price and sell a call option with a higher strike price. This strategy will limit your risk while giving you the potential for profit if the token price goes up.


### Calendar Spread
Another type of spread is a calendar spread. A calendar spread involves buying and selling options with the same strike price but different expiration dates. This strategy can be used to profit from changes in the implied volatility of the options.
