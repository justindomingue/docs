# Capital effiency

Capital efficiency is a broad term for how efficiently an entity spends its assets to operate and grow. Specifically, capital efficiency measures how much of a given asset (as in tokens, fiat, stock) is put into making revenue Vs. how much revenue a given entity is expecting to make from that investment.

Options trading can be a powerful tool for investors looking to maximize their capital efficiency. By leveraging the unique features of options, traders can better manage risk, generate additional income, and potentially enhance returns. In this section we'll explore the basics of options trading and delve into strategies that can help you optimize your capital's potential.
For a primer on terminology see [here](/docs/glossary.md).


### Leverage

Options trading allows investors to control a more significant amount of the underlying asset with a smaller capital outlay. By purchasing options instead of the underlying asset, traders can gain exposure to price movements while committing less capital upfront. 

### Risk Management

Options can be used to hedge existing positions or to protect a portfolio from adverse price movements. For example, an investor can purchase put options to protect against potential declines in a stock's value. This way, the investor limits the maximum loss while maintaining the potential for gains.

### Strategies for Capital Efficiency

#### Covered Calls

Covered call writing is a popular strategy that involves selling call options against a long stock position. This strategy generates additional income through option premiums, which can help offset the cost of holding the stock. If the stock price remains below the strike price at expiration, the investor keeps the premium and can continue to sell calls.

#### Cash-Secured Puts

In this strategy, an investor sells a put option while holding enough cash to cover the potential obligation to buy the underlying asset. If the asset's price remains above the strike price at expiration, the investor keeps the premium. If the price falls below the strike price, the investor buys the asset at the strike price, effectively acquiring the stock at a discount.

#### Vertical Spreads

Vertical spreads involve simultaneously buying and selling options with the same expiration date but different strike prices. This strategy reduces the upfront cost of trading options, allowing investors to profit from smaller price movements while limiting potential losses.


Options trading offers unique opportunities for investors seeking to maximize capital efficiency. By employing smart strategies like covered calls, cash-secured puts, and vertical spreads, traders can enhance returns, generate additional income, and better manage risk. As with any investment, it's essential to understand the mechanics and risks associated with options trading before diving in. With proper knowledge and discipline, options can become a powerful tool in your investing arsenal.
